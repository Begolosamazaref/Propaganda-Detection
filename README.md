# AMD-Classification

## About
International Capstone Project focused on improving early detection of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Our team used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing to analyze retinal images, achieving 97% accuracy with data augmentation and transfer learning.

## Project Structure
- **AMD_Dataset**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing
- **Article**: Documentation and research papers
- **BackEndCode_AMD_Classification**: Backend implementation code
- **Demo**: Demonstration files and examples
- **Docs**: Project documentation
- **MSE_MSLE_model**: Model implementation using MSE and MSLE loss functions

## Technologies Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Image Processing
- Transfer Learning
- Data Augmentation

## Results
The model achieved 97% accuracy in detecting AMD from retinal images.
